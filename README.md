# Godot 4 Open RPG

![Godot Open RPG banner](media/Open-RPG.png)

OpenRPG is a a demo showing how to create a classical turn-based RPG in Godot 4. It's currently a work-in-progress.

**You need to use Godot 4.3 to open the project!** You can find Godot 4.3 on the [Godot website](https://godotengine.org/).

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide the gamedev community with a demo that shows one solid way to create and structure the code for a 2D RPG in Godot 4. You can reuse the code in your own projects, and also learn from the project's codebase.

As we're teachers, our focus is on providing a learning resource that is both practical and educational. We're not trying to build a framework.

We're putting heavy emphasis on code that:

- Is updated to take advantage of what GDScript 4 has to offer.
- Is accessible to users with solid code foundations. It should be a good starting point and reference for those diving into an RPG project.
- Follows our [GDScript guidelines](https://gdquest.gitbook.io/gdquests-guidelines/godot-gdscript-guidelines).

## Our Mission

Together, we're creating a codebase and tools to show you some good Godot practices to create:

- Turn-based games.
- A combat system.
- An inventory system.
- Character progression.
- Maps with transitions, dialogues, grid-based movement, and more.
- User interface with multiple menus.
