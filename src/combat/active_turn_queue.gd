## Responds to [Battler] and input signals to determine when and how Battlers may act.
##
## The ActiveTurnQueue sorts Battlers neatly into a queue as they are ready to act. Time is paused
## as Battlers act and is resumed once actors are finished acting. The queue ceases once the player
## or enemy Battlers have been felled, signaling that the combat has finished.
##
## Note: the turn queue defers action/target selection to either AI or player input. While
## time is slowed for player input, it is not stopped completely which may result in an AI Battler
## acting while the player is taking their turn.
class_name ActiveTurnQueue extends Node2D

## Emitted immediately once the player has won or lost the battle. Note that all animations (such
## as the player or AI battlers disappearing) are not yet completed.
## This is the point at which most UI elements will disappear.
signal battlers_downed
## Emitted once a player has won or lost a battle, indicating whether or not it may be considered a 
## victory for the player. All combat animations have finished playing.
signal combat_finished(is_player_victory: bool)
## Emitted when a player-controlled battler finished playing a turn. That is, when the _play_turn()
## method returns.
signal player_turn_finished

## Allows pausing the Active Time Battle during combat intro, a cutscene, or combat end.
