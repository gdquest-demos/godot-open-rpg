## The GamepieceRegistry keeps track of each [Gamepiece] that is currently placed on the board.
##
## Since player movement is locked to gameboard cells (rather than physics-based movement), this
## allows UI elements, cutscenes, and other systems to quickly lookup gamepieces by name or
## location. Additionally, it allows pathfinders to see which cells are occupied or unoccupied.
## [/br][/br]Note that only ONE gamepiece may occupy a cell and will block the movement of other
## gamepieces.
